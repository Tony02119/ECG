Introduction

ECG analysis is crucial for diagnosing cardiac problems. With advancements in AI and machine learning, it is now possible to develop models capable of automatically detecting anomalies in ECGs, thus providing valuable support to healthcare professionals.
Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

    Python 3.7 or higher
    pip (Python package manager)
    The following Python libraries:
        numpy
        pandas
        matplotlib
        scikit-learn
        tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the model used)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecg-analyser.git
cd ecg-analyser

Create and activate a virtual environment:

sh

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:

sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare your ECG data following the format described in the "Repository Structure" section.
    Run the training script:

    sh

    python train_model.py --data_path path/to/data

Parameters for train_model.py

    --data_path: Path to the folder containing ECG data.
    --epochs: (optional) Number of epochs for training. Default: 50.
    --batch_size: (optional) Batch size for training. Default: 32.
