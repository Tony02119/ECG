    "### Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "First, collecting valid and usable data is essential. In the field of ECG, we face high constraints regarding hardware. New and modern measurement devices are emerging: smartwatches, cardiac arrest alert systems, integrated chips, and much more in the coming years. Initially, we needed a mass of usable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECG Data\n",
    "We searched for ECG datasets annotated with diagnoses. We will use public databases such as the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database or the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The \"Heartbeat\" dataset used in this project comes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH). This dataset is a commonly used resource for the analysis of electrocardiograms (ECG) and the detection of cardiac arrhythmias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Origin**: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. This database was created by MIT in collaboration with Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. It was introduced in 1980 and has been widely used for the research and development of arrhythmia detection algorithms.\n",
    "- **Objective**: To provide a standardized dataset for evaluating arrhythmia detection algorithms, facilitating comparisons between different approaches, and promoting research in the field of digital cardiology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Format\n",
    "The data format is an important point in handling them. In our case, we will prioritize public formats such as CSV and WFDB, and then, if possible, translatable proprietary formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Heartbeat\" dataset we use is derived from the MIT-BIH database and consists of two main files:\n",
    "- **mitbih_train.csv**: File containing training data.\n",
    "- **mitbih_test.csv**: File containing test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CSV file has the same structure but with different datasets for training and testing.\n",
    "- **Rows**: Each row represents a unique heartbeat.\n",
    "- **Columns**: Each column represents a data point of the ECG signal. The number of columns may vary, but typically there are 187 columns representing ECG signal data points, and a final column representing the class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "| ECG Point 1 | ECG Point 2 | ... | ECG Point 187 | Label |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|-----|---------------|-------|\n",
    "| 0.1         | 0.2         | ... | 0.5           | 0     |\n",

    "| 0.3         | 0.4         | ... | 0.6           | 0     |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ECG Points (0 to 186)**: These are the preprocessed and normalized ECG signal values.\n",
    "- **Label (187)**: The class label corresponding to the type of heartbeat. Here are the possible classes:\n",
    "  - **0**: Normal beat\n",
    "  - **1**: Atrial premature beat\n",
    "  - **2**: Premature ventricular contraction\n",
    "  - **3**: Fusion of ventricular and normal beat\n",
    "  - **4**: Unclassifiable beat\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between Training and Test Files\n",
    "- **mitbih_train.csv**: Contains the data used to train the model. It represents a large portion of the dataset and covers a variety of heartbeats to allow the model to learn the distinctive characteristics of each class.\n",
    "- **mitbih_test.csv**: Contains the data used to test the model after training. It is essential to test the model on data it has not seen during training to evaluate its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading Data\n",
    "To load the data, we will use a library called Pandas. It offers data structures like DataFrames, which are two-dimensional tables, making data cleaning, transformation, and analysis easier. We will also use it to load data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL) and prepare them for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Normalization\n",
    "Data normalization is an important step in preprocessing data before using it for training a machine learning model. It centers and scales the features to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This can improve the performance and convergence speed of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization has several advantages:\n",
    "- **Uniform Scale**: All features have the same scale, which is crucial for algorithms that use distances or weights.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Machine learning algorithms converge faster and more stably.\n",
    "- **Comparability**: The values of different features become comparable, facilitating interpretation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data normalization, we will use the scikit-learn (sklearn) library. It offers several data preprocessing techniques. Sklearn provides different normalization methods, such as StandardScaler for standardization, MinMaxScaler for scaling to a specific range, or RobustScaler for robust normalization against outliers.\n"
